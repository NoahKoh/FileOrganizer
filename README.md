# FileOrganizer
A simple file organizer with three essential functions: Organize, Extract, and Delete Empty Folders.

## Background
As a student, I often found myself with lots of unorganized files scattered across various directories.  
Facing this mess, I took it upon myself to build a file organizer with the functions I want.

## Features
- Organize Files:
  - Automatically categorizes files based on their extensions
  - Moves files into appropriate folders (e.g., Audio, Image, Text Document, etc.)
- Extract Files:
  - Extracts files from subdirectories and moves them to the selected directory.
- Delete Empty Folders:
  - Removes empty folders within the specified directory.

## Usage
- Choose a Directory:
  - Click the “Browse” button to select the folder you want to organize.
- Organize Files:
  - Click the “Organize” button to categorize files.
  - Files will be moved to relevant folders based on their extensions.
- Extract Files:
  - Click the “Extract” button to move files from subdirectories to the selected directory.
- Delete Empty Folders:
  - Click the “Delete Empty Folders” button to remove any empty directories.

## Configuration
- Use the “Configure” button to customize file categories and extensions.
- You can export and import configurations using JSON files.
